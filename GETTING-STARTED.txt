After downloading this Project you need to get Symfony running.
This is done by composer.

So please download composer from http://getcomposer.org/
after that, change into the project folder and do the following (assuming composer.phar 
is in the current path:

php composer.phar update

This should download and install all neccessary Symfony-Packages ("Bundles")
After that, you should be able to start hacking.

(Besides: if you have installed the symfony-plugin for Eclipse
from http://symfony.dubture.com/, right-click on the project and 

Composer --> Update dependencies 

should also work)
